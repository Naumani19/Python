# Python

Python Projects that explore the basics of python programming and build up to more challenging problems. 
The course is CPS 109- Ryerson University
The textbook: Introduction to Computing and Programming in Python, by Guzdial and Ericson

Lab 2-------------Strings Intro---------------------------------------------
The learning objectives Chapter 3:
• manipulate strings
• build strings with concatenation
• use loops to iterate over the characters in a string
• convert strings into lists for word manipulation
• use array notation s[i] for accessing elements of strings and lists
• use if-statements to branch in the instruction seq


Lab 3-------------Strings Adv. + intro to digital imaging----------------------------------------------
The learning objectives Chapter 3 and 4:
Same as above + understand how images are digitized
• identify different models of color, but mainly RGB, the most common for the computer
• to manipulate color values in pictures, increasing and decreasing them
• to convert color to grayscale
• to negate a picture
• to use matrix representation to find pixels in a picture
• to use picture objects and pixel objects
• to use iteration with a for loop to change color values of pixels in a picture
• to nest blocks of code
• to choose between having a function return a value or just have a side effect
• to determine the scope of a variable name
