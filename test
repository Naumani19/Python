You have written an essay that should be at least five pages long, but it is only 4.5 pages. You
decide to use your new python skills to stretch it out by putting spaces between each letter and
the next. Write a function that takes a string and a number and prints out the string with number
of spaces between each pair of letters:
>>> spacedout(“It was a dark and stormy night”, 3)
I t w a s a d a r k a n d s t o m y n i g h t
def spacedout(string,n):
pile = ''
space = ' '
for index in string:
pile = pile + index + space*n
print pile

6) You are afraid that is too obvious, so you decide to write spacedout2(string, n)
which puts n spaces between each pair of words, rather than letters:
>>> spacedout2(“It was a dark and stormy night”, 3)
It was a dark and stomy night

def spacedout2(string,n):
pile = ''
space = ' '
for index in string:
if not index in " ":
pile = pile + index
if index in " ":
pile = pile + index + space*n
print pile
